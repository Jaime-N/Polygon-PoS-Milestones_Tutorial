## 1. Introduction to Bor and Heimdall in Polygon PoS

### 1.1 What is Bor?

Bor is the execution layer in the Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network. It is responsible for:

- Aggregating transactions into blocks.
- Managing the execution of smart contracts.
- Maintaining the state of the Polygon network, such as account balances.

### 1.2 What is Heimdall?

Heimdall acts as the proof of stake layer and uses Tendermint BFT consensus. It decides which validators should be producing blocks in Bor in each span (based on their stake). It also:

- Submits checkpoints to the Ethereum mainnet, securing the Polygon chain.
- Helps in arriving at finality of Bor blocks using Milestones.
- Plays a key role in state sync mechanism from L1 to Bor.

### 1.3 How Do They Work Together?

Heimdall determines the validators that should be part of the next span. Bor fetches these details from Heimdall and the selected validators start producing blocks based on the consensus rules. Heimdall also periodically aggregates Bor blocks and submits checkpoints to L1 (Ethereum) to secure the network.

Heimdall is also responsible for the finality of blocks produced by Bor which is achieved through a mechanism called Milestones. And we will be diving deeper into Milestones in this tutorial.

### 1.4 More on Bor and Heimdall

Check out the official [documentation](https://docs.polygon.technology/pos/architecture/#architectural-overview) for more details on Bor and Heimdall

## 2. The Evolution of Finality: Before and After Milestones

### 2.1 Before Milestones

In the traditional setup:

- Finality was **probabilistic** until a checkpoint was submitted to L1. Users and developers had to wait for many blocks (some applications waited 256 blocks) to be created before they could be reasonably sure that a transaction was final. This meant that there was always a small chance of a reorganization (reorg), where a different chain might become the canonical chain.

- Checkpoints to Ethereum: Heimdall would submit checkpoints to Ethereum after every 256 blocks (minimum), anchoring Polygon’s state to the security of Ethereum. However, finality on the Polygon chain itself was slow and uncertain until this checkpoint was confirmed.

Finality achieved after 256 blocks (approx. 10 minutes)

### 2.2 After Milestones

With the introduction of milestones:

- Finality is **deterministic** even before a checkpoint is submitted to L1. After a certain number of blocks (minimum 12), a milestone is proposed and validated by Heimdall. Once 2/3+ of the network agrees, the milestone is finalized, and all transactions up to that milestone are considered final, with no chance of reorganization.

- Separation of Checkpoints and Milestones: Checkpoints still occur every 256 blocks (minimum) and are submitted to Ethereum. However, milestones provide much faster finality on the Polygon chain itself, using Heimdall layer for finalization, improving the user experience significantly.

Finality achieved after 30 blocks (approx. 1 minute)

### 3.2 Using the Milestone API

Here's a simple code example to check if a transaction has reached finality using the milestone mechanism.

Import Relevant Libraries:
```typescript
import { createPublicClient, http, Hash } from 'viem'
import { polygon, polygonAmoy } from 'viem/chains'
import { program } from 'commander'
```

Here's the implementation of Checking Transaction Finality BEFORE Milestones Implementation.
```typescript
async function pre_milestones_checkFinality(client: any, txHash: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const tx = await client.getTransaction({ hash: `0x${txHash}` })
  if (!tx || !tx.blockNumber) return false
  const latestBlock: Block = await client.getBlock({ blockTag: 'finalized' })

  console.log(`Latest finalized block: ${latestBlock.number}`)
  console.log(`Your transaction block: ${tx.blockNumber}`)

  // Checking whether there has been 256 blocks since the transaction was included in a block
  if (latestBlock.number !== null && latestBlock.number - tx.blockNumber >= 256) {
    console.log("Your transaction block has been confirmed after 256 blocks");
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```

Here's the implementation of Checking Transaction Finality AFTER Milestones Implementation
```typescript
async function milestones_checkFinality(client: any, txHash: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const tx = await client.getTransaction({ hash: `0x${txHash}` })
  if (!tx || !tx.blockNumber) return false
  const latestBlock: Block = await client.getBlock({ blockTag: 'finalized' })

  console.log(`Latest finalized block: ${latestBlock.number}`)
  console.log(`Your transaction block: ${tx.blockNumber}`)

  // Checking whether the finalized block number via milestones has reached the transaction block number.
  if (latestBlock.number !== null && latestBlock.number > tx.blockNumber) {
    console.log("Your transaction block has been confirmed after 16 blocks");
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```

> Please note that this is just a demo purpose to show the previous implementations, since Milestones has already been implemented in the protocol, therefore, 16 blocks is the minimum time for finality, the `pre_milestones_checkFinality` function is not needed anymore in actual implementation. Just use the `milestones_checkFinality` function to check your transaction finality.

### 3.3 Running the Code Locally

- Step 1: Copy the code into a file named milestones.ts.

- Step 2: Install the required dependencies by running: 
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Step 3: Run the code using Node.js with the required command-line arguments:
  ```bash
  npx ts-node milestones.ts --txHash <transaction_hash> --function <function_name> --network <network_name>
  ```
  Replace <transaction_hash> with the actual transaction hash, <function_name> with either pre_milestones or milestones, and <network_name> with either polygon or amoy.

- Step 4: Observe the output to determine if your transaction has been finalized based on the selected milestone mechanism and network.

### 3.5 Results

The results should show whether the transaction has been finalized based on the selected milestone mechanism and network.
Usually Milestones will taking 1-2 minutes to finalize the transaction. Result as follows:

Here's a screenshot of the `pre_milestones_checkFinality` function, where it shows that the new blocks are not yet 256:

### 3.4 Experimenting Further
Modify the code to check different transactions and networks to see how finality is achieved with milestones on various Polygon networks.
